Hello, everyone! Welcome to my Website! My name is Geraline Trossi-Torres. I'm a second-year PhD student in the Biological Sciences Department at the University of Idaho. I enjoy reading good sci-fi and fantasy books when I am not in the lab doing research. If not, I'll be playing with my Xbox or Nintendo Switch.
