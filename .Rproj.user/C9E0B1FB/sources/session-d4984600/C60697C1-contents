My name is Geraline Trossi-Torres. I'm a second-year PhD student in the Biological Sciences Department at the University of Idaho. I am part of Dr. Scott Grieshaber's lab, which is interested in understanding the developmental cycle of *Chlamydia trachomatis*. Our lab uses various molecular biology techniques, specifically promoter-reporter plasmid vectors.
