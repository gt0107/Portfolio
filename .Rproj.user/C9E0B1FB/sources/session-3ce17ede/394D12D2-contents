Hello, everyone! Welcome to my Website! My name is Geraline Trossi-Torres. I'm a second-year PhD student in the Biological Sciences Department at the University of Idaho. I enjoy reading good sci-fi and fantasy books when I am not in the lab doing research. If not, I'll be playing with my Xbox or Nintendo Switch.

My website provides more information about the type of research we do in our lab and the project I am currently working on. You will also have access to my curriculum vitae and recent publications. Have fun browsing around. If any questions arise, I have a link to my email so you can contact me.
