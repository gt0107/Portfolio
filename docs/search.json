I enjoy reading good sci-fi and fantasy books when I am not in the lab doing research. If not, I’ll be playing with my Xbox or Nintendo Switch.\nMy website provides more information about the type of research we do in our lab and the project I am currently working on, and some of my previous research work. You will also have access to my curriculum vitae and recent publications. Have fun browsing around. If any questions arise, I have a link to my email so you can contact me."

I am currently working to understand more about Chlamydia persistence; during antibiotic stress, in an in vitro cell culture setting, we have a halt on infection, and once the antibiotic stressor is removed, it starts to replicate and infect. The study of persistence in Chlamydia has been ongoing for a while, but there are still some aspects that need to be looked at, especially in regards to persistence to certain antibiotics, which can lead to treatment failure."

    "text": "Previous Research Work\n\nUnderstanding the interaction of α-crystallin with membrane cholesterol and cholesterol bilayer domains in the human eye lens plasma membrane\nUnderstanding the mechanism of α-crystallin, which increases light scattering, induces cataract formation. Cholesterol in the lens membrane is lower in cataract lenses than normal lens. In our previous studies show that the Cholesterol bilayer domain inhibits the association of α-crystallin to the lens membrane, which plays a positive physiological role in protecting against cataract formation.We used Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Instrumentation (CW-EPR) as our main biophysics instrumentation for collecting data.\n\n\nInfluence of genetic variants on the inflammatory response and the severity of asthma in Puerto Ricans\nThis was a collaborative research project, in where we evaluated the influence of genetic variants on the inflammatory response and the severity of asthma in Puerto Ricans. I had the experience of working with patient recruitment and did different lab techniques under the IRB and HIPPAA protocols (e.g., blood work assays). This research presented insight into how asthma affects Puerto Ricans at a genetic level and provided insight to study this problem further to develop an adjuvant therapy.\n\n\nUnderstand the mechanism of calcium sulfide (CaS) nanoclusters in pancreatic cancer (Mia Paca-2 cell line)\nIn this project, we investigated the effects of CaS nanoclusters on the proliferation and migration of this cell line. Identifying more effective therapeutic methods is essential for enhancing the treatment of this type of cancer. The use of nanoparticles in biomedical applications is now a viable option in treating cancer. I performed various protocols to determine the migration and proliferation of the Mia Paca-2 cell line. This treatment can represent an innovation in cancer therapeutics."
