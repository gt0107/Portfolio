Cholesterol in the lens membrane is lower in cataract lenses than normal lens. In our previous studies show that the Cholesterol bilayer domain inhibits the association of α-crystallin to the lens membrane, which plays a positive physiological role in protecting against cataract formation. We used Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Instrumentation (CW-EPR) as our main biophysics instrumentation for collecting data.\n&lt;/div&gt;"
