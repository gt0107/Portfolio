## *Chlamydia* Persistence

    <div>
        In the Grieshaber's lab, we focus on understanding the developmental cycle of *Chlamydia trachomatis*. I am currently working to understand more about *Chlamydia* persistence; during antibiotic stress, in an *in vitro* cell culture setting, we have a halt on infection, and once the antibiotic stressor is removed, it starts to replicate and infect. The study of persistence in *Chlamydia* has been ongoing for a while, but there are still some aspects that need to be looked at, especially in regards to persistence to certain antibiotics, which can lead to treatment failure.

### Understanding the interaction of α-crystallin with membrane cholesterol and cholesterol bilayer domains in the human eye lens plasma membrane

<div class="flex-container">

    <div>
        Understanding the mechanism of α-crystallin, which increases light scattering, induces cataract formation. Cholesterol in the lens membrane is lower in cataract lenses than normal lens. In our previous studies show that the Cholesterol bilayer domain inhibits the association of α-crystallin to the lens membrane, which plays a positive physiological role in protecting against cataract formation. We used Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Instrumentation (CW-EPR) as our main biophysics instrumentation for collecting data.
